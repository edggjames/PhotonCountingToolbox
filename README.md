# unwrapRawPhotonArrivalData
Extracting a photon arrival time series from Flex02 raw data.
Also extracts all other useful parameters.
8 bit data format is supported, need to write a 16 bit format too.

Test scripts to:
  - Extract, visualise and save raw photon data from the four D1_DCS samples.
  - Extract and save raw photon data from eight D2_DCS_AOT_DCS_Flow files (except sample 7 which is in 16 bit!)
  - Extract and save raw photon data from two D2_DCS_AOT_DCS_Intralipid files
